CN Lab – Assignment 8
Objective

Using Thread library and TCP sockets.
Exercise

Write a program in C using thread library and TCP sockets to build a chat server which enable clients communicating to each other through the chat server. Message logs must be maintained in the server in a text file. Each client will see the conversations in real time. Clients must handled by a server thread. (Keep it like a group chatbox)
Steps/Hints

    In server-side, use:

while( (newfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&client, (socklen_t*)&c)) )
{
    printf("Accepted");
    if( pthread_create( &thread_id, NULL, client_handler, (void*) &newfd) < 0)
    {
        perror("Thread error");
        return 1;
    };
}

    Maintain a log.txt file in the server for saving conversations with timestamps. Conversations will be fetched to all the clients automatically.
