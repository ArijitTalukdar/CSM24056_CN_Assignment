CN Lab – Assignment 2 Objective: To gain experience of TCP Socket Programming for simple applications.

Exercise: Write a program using TCP socket to implement the following: i. Server maintains records of fruits in the format: fruit-name, quantity Last-sold, (server timestamp), ii. Multiple client purchase the fruits one at a time, iii. The fruit quantity is updated each time any fruit is sold, iv. Send regret message to a client if the requested quantity of the fruit is not available. v. Display the customer ids <IP, port> who has done transactions already. This list should be updated in the server every time a transaction occurs. vi. The total number of unique customers who did some transaction will be displayed to the customer every time.

Steps/ Hints: (if any)

    Use at least two mininet hosts as clients,
    Server must be kept running using a loop condition,
    Take another socket (from accept() call) for keeping client information,
    Server must send the current stock information to the transacting host as queried in the question.

Learning Outcomes:

    Multiple client's communication via server socket can be learned.
